CLASS AND OBJECT

A class in Java is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes.
It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
For example, Student is a class while a particular student named Anunay is an object.

Declaration

access_modifier class <class_name>
{  
    data member;  
    method;  
    constructor;
    nested class;
}

All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument 
constructor, also called the default constructor. This default constructor calls the class parentâ€™s no-argument constructor(as it contains only one statement i.e super();),
or the Object class constructor if the class has no other parent (as the Object class is the parent of all classes either directly or indirectly).
